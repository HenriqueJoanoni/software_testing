/**
 * has been created to tell us whether or not we are allowed to sleep in.
 * The parameter weekday is true if it is a weekday, and the parameter vacation is true if we are on vacation.
 * We sleep in if it is not a weekday or we're on vacation.
 * Write the method so that it returns true if we sleep in and false if we donâ€™t.
 * You will also need to write a main method to call this method.
 * Your main method should then display a message indicating whether or not we can sleep in.
 * Test the method through the use of different values for the variables weekday and vacation.
